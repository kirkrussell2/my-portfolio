                  Currently, I am working as a Flare Data Manager and Project Manager for a physical therapy company that manages 26 clinics across 3 states called Movement For Life and have started my own company Krusell Consulting. I have been with Movement for Life for about 4 years. My role involves using feedback from management and employees to improve their internal documentation database using MadCap Flare and make it more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly. Additionally, I also contribute as a project manager for other technological or software-related projects. In my consulting company, I work with my clients to help improve existing database structures to increase reliability, migrate other systems into Madcap Flare.I have worked with companies and teams across the world from Los Angeles, New York, London, Netherland, and many more.                  <br />
                  <br />Given my entrepreneurial and curious nature, I gravitate towards problem-solving both from the technical and business sides. This combined with my Honors degree program in Mechanical Engineering gives me a foundation that helps me work to exceed project expectations.
                  <br />
                  <br />I have also worked as the project manager on a team from multiple universities to compete in the 2020 John Hopkins/Stanford COVID-19 Research Design competition where we were tasked with finding solutions for slowing the spread of COVID-19 in areas where clean water was not easily accessible. A particularly exciting and challenging aspect of this project was the short timeline for completion and cooperation of remote diverse team members. In high school, I used my technical and athletic skills to contribute to my basketball team. I utilized Java to develop a basketball statistics program to analyze and optimize our player time and efficiency on the court which helped make our team more successful. I have always had a deep passion for human health and development which pushes me to continue learning as much as I can about how the human body works and what its limitations are. I have completed triathlons, ultra-marathons, competed in some of the higher levels of basketball and track and field, and as an athlete am always looking for better insights into how my body is responding to the load I am giving it.
                  <br />
                  <br />My goal is to further develop my problem-solving, computer science knowledge, and project management skills.
